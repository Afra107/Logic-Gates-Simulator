# Logic Gates Simulation Project

Welcome to the Logic Gates Simulation Project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for simulating various logic gates and designing circuits. Whether you're a student learning about digital electronics or a professional circuit designer, this project offers a versatile platform to experiment with different logic gate configurations.

## Features

- Simulate basic logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.
- Construct complex circuits by connecting multiple logic gates.
- Visualize the behavior of circuits in real-time.
- Customize inputs and observe outputs.
